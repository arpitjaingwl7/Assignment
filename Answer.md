1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.


=>>
The relationship between the Product and ProductCategory entities is a one-to-many relationship, where each product belongs to one category, and each category can have multiple products. The category_id field in the Product schema serves as a foreign key referencing the _id field of documents in the ProductCategory collection.


2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

==>
To ensure each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned, use a foreign key constraint that references a "Category" table.
The foreign key constraint ensures that every CategoryID in the Product table corresponds to an existing category in the Category table. This way, it's impossible to assign an invalid category to a product.
